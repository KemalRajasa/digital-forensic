But what if I am not interested in train schedules?","review":"I spend a lot of time on google maps, and it truly is one of my favorite things on my iPad.  The ability to immediately view anyplace on the planet and in many cases, see the street view - is just amazing.\n\nI do have one major disappointment, though.  A few iterations ago, google changed something and I really hate the update.  I am not at all interested in train schedules.  I need to see train stations and their info, photographs, and so forth - and I have no need whatsoever for the schedules since I have to access train station information for cities in which I don’t live.  Every single time I go to a train station in google maps, I have to take an extra step to find the “Info” button and click it, to get rid of the unnecessary train schedule information.  This is a massive annoyance.  It would make my life much easier if they could offer the option to eliminate train schedule information and just treat the sites like other businesses.\n\nOther than this one problem, google maps is just about perfect for me.  I still think street view was the most incredible vision by someone who knew how to think outside the box and truly innovate.  This is a way for me to visit and explore my beloved Japan even when I cannot be there; and I am grateful for that capability.","date":"2021-10-15T13:38:42Z","userName":"Catman 63 "}},{"id":"6940468258","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":3,"title":"Alright","review":"It’s alright. Buggy sometimes even with good signal. When I search along the route it will sometimes not come up with any search results, only for me to pass the very thing I searched for prior in my drive. And no it wasn’t a new business, it had been around for years. Also when I search places, one will say it’s 10 minutes out of the way while the other says only a few. Only to realize that the faster one ended up not being as simple as they said, and that the slower one (+10 minutes) was only slow because for some reason it had me take side roads completely around it before arriving, when I could have simply turned directly into it from the road I was on, making it a quick trip. Not all gas stations show up in searches, it almost seems to favor the expensive gas stations. There’s doesn’t seem to be an algorithm that keeps track of the bad traffic times. It will re rout my whole trip to a significantly slower route if it senses traffic, even if that traffic is close to the end of my trip hours away and will be cleared well before I get to that point. If you’re a contractor that has to go in and out of many neighborhoods, it normally recognizes certain entrances while not recognizing others, so it will take you completely around the neighborhood 30 minutes away to the other entrance when you have just passed a perfectly good entrance that has been around forever.

I say, it’s a great tool to use and the misuses of it, like tool will get you in a bind. Would one use a hammer to insert a screw? A paper atlas won’t tell you traffic updates, speed traps, items in the road, places to park or eat. At any rate I use this app in Satellite view, I look in great detail the route it’s plotted out for me. I look at streets, roads, everything. You see I am making sure trucks can go down the route. If I see a truck on a street along my route, I know that there is a 80% chance I can. I look to make sure it’s not trying to send me down a ATV trail.....which how accurate Google maps is.....to even have such trails on a map is amazing. In the end it’s a great tool for drivers car or truck. For walkers or bicycles. Just use it SMART. It’s not design to fail you. Only you can do that. Plan your route, look at it, while driving, READ the road signs. Don’t just use this I.E: input destination, and go....follow it blindly.

Now, I’m not a moron and I know the sun rises in the east and sets in the west and whatnot and it is easy enough to figure out my cardinal directions if it is early morning or late afternoon but when there are fifteen people waiting for me to make a turn and it’s high noon, overcast, a moonless night or any of a half dozen other circumstances under which it is difficult to decipher cardinal directions on the fly I REALLY wish it would just say go left or right!!!!  I cannot tell you how many times I have just picked a direction and turned the wrong way and then had to wait on the app to re-route me when it could have been easily avoided by simply saying turn left instead of head north. I use the app a lot since I drive for a popular delivery service and when I get lost because I head north instead of south I end up being late for my delivery which lowers my tip and my rating which reduces the number of deliveries I am offered and impacts my ability to make a living all because it expects me to figure out north from south when I’m already stressed, in a hurry, and trying to arrive somewhere I’ve never been before all while being timed. I’m certainly not the only person who can’t tell north from south when stressed. Please, do me a favor and reduce the mental arithmetic it takes me to drive when under pressure and just say left or right.","date":"2021-10-03T06:22:44Z","userName":"WaltKen47"}},{"id":"6653205045","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":1,"title":"No longer user friendly","review":"App used to be okay. There was a time when this app would give you turn by turn navigation, after you made a turn it would indicate the next regardless of distance, so you could anticipate the next set of directions and change lanes accordingly. A few updates ago they removed this feature for who knows why. Initially it wasn't a big deal because you could simply zoom out quickly to see the next turn yourself. Now they have made it so sensitive if you touch the screen or attempt to move the map to see where to go next it starts spinning wildly and fighting whatever you try and do to see the location you are going towards. For example you are driving straight and are going to make a left turn in 1 mile and  the address is only 1.2 miles away. So you think “okay I can zoom out a bit to see if the business is on the left or right side of the road after the turn” WRONG if you try to slide the map further to see where to go it will start orienting itself in opposition of what you are trying to do. Zoom in, zoom out, and flip your always North facing settings for no apparent reason. Stop messing with the apps fundamental settings you are going to be responsible for accidents, erratic lane changes, missed exits off the freeway, etc. It is ridiculous and absolutely irresponsible to make such drastic changes in an apps basic functions that people need to use daily.","date":"2020-11-16T22:02:33Z","userName":"getdemgators"}},{"id":"6871391273","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"isEdited":false,"rating":4,"title":"BACKOUT or Put a FIX IN for buggy update..","review":"Love this map app.. especially being able to share my location real-time with other people.

Kept ppl I formed without a lot of texts or phone calls. \uD83D\uDC4D\n\nThat said... based on my interaction with the app a recent release royally screwed up city navigation where I’m at near Fort Meyers FL.  I hope the update I just installed corrects the issues and madness this app has caused me the last few days bc I don’t know this city from Adam.  The app has been literally unusable for 2-3 days navigating the area.   So bad the audio told me to go south when I needed to go due north.  I looked at the screen and the satellite image was correct on current location and route to intended location.  I couldn’t get the audio to toggle on at all.  Even after reboot of my iPhone 10.  That’s when had no choice but exit your app and use map app plan B.  \n\n IN SUMMARY, google developers please don’t make me find a new “everyday use” map app so I can rely on it to tell me the correct information in this city.  If you haven’t already,, backout, research issues if you aren’t aware, or push an emergency update with fixes to correct things.
